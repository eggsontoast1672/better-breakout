# Better Breakout

A while ago, I decided to try my hand at creating a breakout clone in Rust. I'm
not sure how far I got, but I don't think I got too far. I've been becoming
increasingly interested in graphics programming over the course of the last
couple of months, and I've been following along with learnopengl.com's series
of tutorials.

One thing that I've been struggling with is that I can't seem to finish any
projects that I start. It's actually a big problem. Because of that, this
project will serve two purposes. First of all, it will be to improve my skills
at OpenGL and graphics programming, and second, I want to see this project
through from start to finish.

## Building and Running

More here to come.

## Roadmap

I'm taking a different approach with this project than I normally do. The
README.md file (the one you're reading) will contain a checklist of items that
I can implement one at a time, just to keep me organized and focused.

* [ ] Get a window up
* [ ] Display a triangle
* [ ] Display an image

## License Information

Even though I'm following along with a tutorial series, I will not be copying
their code line by line, so the code is going to be my own, at least mostly.
I've decided to license my code under the public domain because I think that's
a chill thing to do. Feel free to use this code for whatever you wish, sell it,
modify it, claim that you wrote it, I genuinely don't care. See LICENSE for the
license text.
